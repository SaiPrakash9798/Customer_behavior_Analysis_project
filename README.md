📊 Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis

A Complete Data Analytics Project Using Python, PostgreSQL, and Power BI



This repository presents a comprehensive end-to-end analysis of customer shopping behavior using a dataset of 3,900 real purchase transactions. The project was designed to uncover actionable insights into customer demographics, purchase patterns, product preferences, and the overall impact of discounts, subscriptions, and shipping choices on revenue.

🔍 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to transform raw transactional data into meaningful business intelligence that supports data-driven decision-making. The analysis integrates:

Python for data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory analysis

PostgreSQL for complex analytical queries and segmentation

Power BI for interactive dashboard visualization (including customer, category, and age-based insights)

The final Power BI dashboard (see image above) showcases key performance metrics such as customer counts, revenue trends, purchase behavior, and category-level sales.

🛠️ Key Components
1. Data Preparation (Python)

Conducted thorough quality checks and handled missing values

Engineered new features including age groups and purchase frequency brackets

Standardized column naming and ensured dataset consistency

Loaded the refined dataset into PostgreSQL for deeper analysis

2. SQL Insights (PostgreSQL)

The SQL layer explored major business questions, including:

Revenue contributions by gender and age groups

Discount dependencies across product types

Subscriber vs. non-subscriber spending

Top-rated products and top-selling items per category

Customer segmentation: New, Returning, and Loyal audiences

Shipping type influence on purchase amounts

3. Power BI Dashboard

Designed a clean, intuitive, and executive-ready dashboard featuring:

Customer KPIs (Total customers, AOV, average ratings)

Subscription behavior distributions

Revenue & sales by category and age group

Shipping type performance

Demographic buying patterns

The dashboard provides an end-to-end view of customer behavior, enabling stakeholders to quickly identify trends and opportunities.

💡 Business Insights & Recommendations

Based on the combined findings across Python, SQL, and Power BI:

Boost Subscription Sign-ups: Subscribers exhibit higher average purchase amounts.

Strengthen Loyalty Programs: Returning and loyal customers form a high-value segment worth nurturing.

Optimize Discount Strategy: Certain products overly rely on discounts, requiring pricing strategy review.

Target High-Value Demographics: The 26–35 age group generates the most revenue and should be prioritized in targeted campaigns.

Enhance Product Positioning: Promote bestsellers and top-rated products in future marketing initiatives.

Technologies Used:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn)

PostgreSQL

Power BI

Excel (for validation and cross-checks)
